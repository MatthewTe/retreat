# Retreat
A basic command line TUI that loads RSS feeds and articles in the terminal. Allowing you to read your morning news letters from the terminal. 

Written using the ratatui Rust framework. Still in the early days of the project and will be adding additional features as I discover the need for them in my day to day use.

Tab through different rss feeds from a remote CSV feed list:

Read individual articles directly in the terminal:
